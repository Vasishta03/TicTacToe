I've created a JavaScript version of the Tic Tac Toe game with the following features:

  - Clean, modern design with a gradient background
  - Responsive grid layout
  - Smooth hover and click animations
  - Player turn indication
  - Win/draw detection
  - Reset game functionality
  - Different colors for X and O players
  - Mobile-friendly design

The game uses:

  - HTML for structure
  - CSS for styling and animations
  - Vanilla JavaScript with classes for game logic

The game is now running on the development server. You can:

  - Click any cell to make a move
  - Take turns between X and O players
  -  See who wins or if it's a draw
  -  Reset the game using the button at the bottom
